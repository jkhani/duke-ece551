  Your final programming assignment is the "mini project."
For this assignment, you have may choose from a few different
options.  You only need to choose ONE of these options (do
NOT  do all of them).  Each mini-project option has
115% possible on it, divided among 4 steps as follows:

Step 1: 50%
Step 2: 30%
Step 3: 20%
Step 4: 15%

This mini-project is due at 11:59:59 PM on Nov 30, giving you almost the entire
month of November to work on it.

For any of these options, you may need to consult other materials
for relevant domain knowledge.  However, you should have obtained the
programming skills to complete the project in this course.  

Your mini-project options are:


 (1) A cache simulator
     You need knowledge from taking 550 to do this.
     This option is excellent preparation for 552 + 590-Performance-Optimization
 (2) A command shell
     You will need to consult man pages about system calls to do this.
     This option is great preparation if you plan to take: 650
 (3) Numerical methods
     You will need some mathematical knowledge to do this.
     You will also need to perform simple parsing, however, you
     can use the code I gave you in c14 to show you how to do so.
     This option is great preparation if you plan to take 681.


I expect these to be polished, well tested pieces of code.
