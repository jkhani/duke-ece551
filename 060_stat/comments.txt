Hi  Joshua, here are some comments on the code quality of your
060 assignment:

Abstraction: Good, but it's better to name the functions based on their functionality to improve readability, instead of just using "line1", "line2", etc. 

Formatting: Good! Just miss adding space between operators in a few lines. There should be a space between ")" and "{" when defining a function's name.

Comments: Very good comments!
